  "Event_Description": "Travis Audubon and the Pease Park Conservancy are collaborating to offer a guided family-friendly walk designed with birding adults in mind—parents, grandparents, or caregivers—who want to enjoy birding without needing to leave the kids at home. While most bird walks require a quieter setting, this outing makes space for families to participate together. Following the walk, we’ll create our own birds using crafting materials at the Tudor Cottage!\n• WHAT TO EXPECT: Texas is home to over 600 bird species, making it one of the most bird-diverse states in the United States! Discover the wonder of birding and appreciate these powerful pollinators with Travis Audubon.\n \nWe'll keep the pace relaxed and the tone welcoming, while still focusing on bird identification, behavior, and habitat—perfect for adults who want to sharpen their birding skills and share the experience with their kids. Children must be accompanied by an adult and be able to follow along with the group.\n \nFollowing the walk, Pease Park Conservancy will lead folks in a “Build-a-Bird” activity at the Tudor Cottage. While all birds have feathers, beaks, wings, and feet, they vary enormously in overall shape, size, and color. Participants will create birds using a variety of materials. The goal is for participants to take what they saw on their bird walk and put it into action by creating their own birds.  As part of the activity, participants will talk about their creation and how their features help them get food.\n \nWe will have ASL interpreters assisting with the walk and crafting components, and Pease Park Conservancy staff will offer bilingual instruction in Spanish if needed. \n• WHAT TO BRING/WEAR:\n \nPlease bring water and wear comfortable shoes! Loaner binos available upon request.\n• PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION: For parking and transportation information, please visit https://peasepark.org/parking.\n• WHERE TO MEET: Once you're at Pease Park (1100 Kingsbury Street), please gather by the large concrete picnic tables located by the Mariachi's Tacos food truck in Kingsbury Commons. Look for Pease Park Conservancy and Travis Audubon team members when you arrive.\n• WEATHER NOTE: In case of inclement weather, we’ll notify registrants by email if we need to cancel.\n• A NOTE ABOUT OUR EVENTS: If you sign up, please make every effort to show up. Our events are free, so all of our community members can attend. But we plan our events to be meaningful for the number of people who register to be there, so please make every effort to attend if you have registered. We understand things come up from time to time, but if you have registered, we look forward to having you there! Thank you!",
